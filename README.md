# Ditzbitz_Engine

This engine is meant to help take some of the tedious setup out of making browser-based games and toys. 

In order to get started: simply instantiate some game objects in the commented area in Engine.js, and start adding logic to the main function.

The main function is scheduled to execute every 17 milliseconds once the setUp function has been executed. Do not execute setUp twice, it will cause errors.
